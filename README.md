# Simple-Form-of-Graduation-Project
The project typically involves training a deep neural network on a large dataset of labeled skin images to learn patterns and
features associated with different types of skin cancer capture spatial patterns in images.
Outputs: Android Application
Goal: Detect whether the tumor is benign or malignant. If malignant, detect the type of malignant
Technical Skills: Deep Learning, CNN, Image Processing, Tensor Flow, Keras, and Android Studio.
